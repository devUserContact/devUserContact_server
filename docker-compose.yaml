#This docker-compose file defines a single service called `mariadb` that uses the official Alpine Linux image. The container is named
#`mariadb`, and the database port (3306) is exposed on the host machine. The environment variables `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and
#`MYSQL_DATABASE` are used to configure the root password and the name of the default database, respectively. Finally, a volume is mounted
#at `./mysql:/var/lib/mysql` to persist data between container restarts.
#
#You can run this docker-compose file using the command `docker-compose up -d`. This will start the container in detached mode (`-d`),
#which means that the output of the container will not be visible on your terminal, but you can still use it by connecting to it through a
#client or by accessing it through another service.
#
#Note that this example is very basic and does not include any additional configuration options or customization. For more advanced usage
#and configuration options, please refer to the official Alpine Linux documentation and MariaDB documentation.[1][2]
